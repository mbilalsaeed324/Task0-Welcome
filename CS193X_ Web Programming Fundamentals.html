<p>Welcome to CS193X! This assignment is designed to help you get set up with your development environment and with our homework turn-in system. It also gives us a chance to get to know you a little better, too!</p>

<p>This is not intended to take a very long time to complete, but please get started sooner rather than later so we can fix any issues before the first real homework assignment.</p>

  <h2 id="part-1-getting-started-with-github">Part 1: Getting started with GitHub</h2>
  <p>We will be using GitHub Classroom for homework distribution and turn-in. This will lead you getting started with GitHub and Git.</p>

  <p><strong>If you are familiar with GitHub and have an account, <a href="https://web.stanford.edu/class/archive/cs/cs193x/cs193x.1176/homework/0-welcome#part-2-get-the-hw0-code">skip to Part 2</a>.</strong></p>

  <h3 class="no_toc" id="q-what-is-git-and-github">Q: What is Git and GitHub?</h3>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Git</strong> is a <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/what-is-version-control">version control system</a>, which is a program that developers use to track and manage changes to source code over time.</li>
    <li><strong>GitHub</strong> is a company that provides hosting for code that is managed by the Git version control system.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Git and GitHub are sophisticated tools for collaborative software development, used by millions of software developers worldwide. Git is incredibly powerful, but it has a somewhat notoriously steep learning curve.</p>

  <p>Luckily for CS193X, we will only be using a very small subset of Git and GitHub’s features.</p>

  <h3 class="no_toc" id="sign-up-for-a-free-github-account">1.  Sign up for a free <a href="https://github.com/">Github account</a></h3>
  <p><em>Skip this if you already have a GitHub account.</em></p>
  <ul>
    <li>You will need a GitHub account to use GitHub Classroom.</li>
    <li>Sign up for one if you don’t have one already.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3 class="no_toc" id="get-the-github-education-pack">2. Get the <a href="https://education.github.com/pack">GitHub Education Pack</a></h3>

  <p><em>Optional: This is useful in general, but not needed or beneficial for CS193X.</em></p>

  <ul>
    <li>This is not necessary for CS193X, but GitHub offers a bunch of free services for students, including free unlimited private GitHub repositories.</li>
    <li>Learn more and sign up via the <a href="https://education.github.com/pack">Student Developer Pack</a>.</li>
  </ul>

</section>

<section class="part">
  <h2 id="part-2-get-the-hw0-code">Part 2: Get the HW0 code</h2>

  <p>In CS193X, we will be using GitHub for the following purposes:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>You will download the homework starter code from GitHub.</li>
    <li>You will upload your homework solution code to GitHub.</li>
    <li>You will publish your web page(s) to the internet via GitHub Pages.</li>
  </ol>

  <h3 class="no_toc" id="accept-the-hw0-assignment">1. Accept the HW0 assignment</h3>

  <ul>
    <li><a href="https://classroom.github.com/assignment-invitations/24a7b13fe5e817ecc496544de9182f8b">Follow this link</a>, where HW0 is stored on GitHub Classroom.</li>
    <li>Click the green “Accept this assignment” button.
<a href="./CS193X_ Web Programming Fundamentals_files/screenshot-accept.png">
<img src="./CS193X_ Web Programming Fundamentals_files/screenshot-accept.png" class="screenshot">
</a></li>
    <li>Follow the link to your newly created assignment on the next screen.

</a></li>
  </ul>

  <h3 class="no_toc" id="download-the-hw0-starter-code">2. Download the HW0 starter code</h3>

  <p>Technically, your newly created assignment is a “GitHub repository.”</p>
  <ul>
    <li>This is a private repository, meaning only you (and the course staff) can access it.</li>
    <li>This is basically a private online folder where you will ultimately store your finished homework files. Right now, though, it contains the starter code for the assignment.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>At this point, you want to download the files in this repository.</p>

  <blockquote>
    <h3 class="no_toc" id="git-speak-for-people-who-are-very-familiar-with-git-already">Git-speak for people who are very familiar with Git already:</h3>

    <p><em>(Please <strong>ignore this box entirely</strong> if you’ve never used git before.)</em></p>
    <ul>
      <li>The “assignment” created for you through the GitHub Classroom UI is a private GitHub repository like any other private GitHub repo you would own.</li>
      <li>You can <strong>clone</strong>, <strong>push</strong>, and <strong>pull</strong> to this repository using the command-line or whatever UI you prefer.</li>
      <li>If you want to use git to manage your assignment (as opposed to the GitHub web UI), just <strong>clone</strong> your assignment repository and <a href="https://web.stanford.edu/class/archive/cs/cs193x/cs193x.1176/homework/0-welcome#part-3-edit-the-hw0-code">skip to Part 3</a>.</li>
    </ul>
  </blockquote>

  <p>To download the starter code via the GitHub UI:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>In your homework repository (i.e. <a href="https://web.stanford.edu/class/archive/cs/cs193x/cs193x.1176/homework/images/your-github-repo.png">this screen</a>), click the green “Clone or download” button.
<a href="./CS193X_ Web Programming Fundamentals_files/screenshot-download.png">
<img src="./CS193X_ Web Programming Fundamentals_files/screenshot-download.png" class="screenshot">
</a></li>
    <li>In the menu that pops up, click “Download ZIP”
<a href="./CS193X_ Web Programming Fundamentals_files/screenshot-download-zip.png">
<img src="./CS193X_ Web Programming Fundamentals_files/screenshot-download-zip.png" class="screenshot">
</a></li>
  </ul>

  <h3 class="no_toc" id="view-the-starter-code-in-a-browser">3. View the starter code in a browser</h3>

  <p>Note that <strong>Chrome</strong> is the recommended browser for the course, and your TAs will be grading your assignments using the Chrome browser. Please either <a href="https://www.google.com/chrome">install and use Chrome</a> for development, or at least make sure to test your assignments in Chrome before submitting them.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Unzip your downloaded zip file somewhere on your computer</li>
    <li>Open “index.html” in Chrome or another browser of your choosing.</li>
    <li>You should see something that looks like the following:
<a href="./CS193X_ Web Programming Fundamentals_files/screenshot-hw0-starter.png">

  </ul>

  <h2 id="part-3-edit-the-hw0-code">Part 3: Edit the HW0 code</h2>

  <h3 class="no_toc" id="download-and-install-atom">1. Download and install Atom</h3>

  <p><em>Optional: We will be using Atom in lecture, but you may use whatever text editor you’d like.</em></p>

  <p>We recommend that you use the <a href="https://atom.io/">Atom text editor</a> for CS193X.</p>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="https://atom.io/">Download and install Atom</a></li>
  </ul>

  <p>Unlike CS106A and 106B, though, it is not very important for you to use Atom if you prefer a different text editor for CS193X. However, the course staff will not provide support for any other editor besides Atom.</p>

  <h3 class="no_toc" id="fix-the-todos-in-indexhtml">2. Fix the TODOs in <code class="highlighter-rouge">index.html</code></h3>

  <ul>
    <li>In Atom (or your preferred text editor), open <code class="highlighter-rouge">index.html</code> and fix the TODOs.</li>
    <li>Here is a screenshot of an example “solution”:
<a href="./CS193X_ Web Programming Fundamentals_files/screenshot-hw0-solved.png">
<img src="./CS193X_ Web Programming Fundamentals_files/screenshot-hw0-solved.png" class="screenshot">
</a></li>
    <li>If you’d like, you can further style, decorate, or modify your page to your liking. This is not required, however.</li>
  </ul>

</section>

<section class="part">

  <h2 id="part-4-upload-to-github">Part 4: Upload to GitHub</h2>

  <p>Now that you’ve completed the homework, you should upload your files back to your Homework 0 repository.</p>

    <p><em>(Please <strong>ignore this box entirely</strong> if you’ve never used git before.)</em></p>
    <ul>
      <li>If you cloned your repository via git, just commit all changes and push them to the repository on GitHub.</li>
      <li>You can now <a href="https://web.stanford.edu/class/archive/cs/cs193x/cs193x.1176/homework/0-welcome#part-5-publish-your-github-page">skip to Part 5</a>.</li>
    </ul>
  </blockquote>

  <ul>
    <li>Navigate to your Homework 0 repository on GitHub (i.e. <a href="https://web.stanford.edu/class/archive/cs/cs193x/cs193x.1176/homework/images/your-github-repo.png">this screen</a>).</li>
    <li>Click the “Upload files” button.
<a href="./CS193X_ Web Programming Fundamentals_files/screenshot-upload.png">
<img src="./CS193X_ Web Programming Fundamentals_files/screenshot-upload.png" class="screenshot">
</a></li>
    <li>On the next screen, select your <code class="highlighter-rouge">index.html</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">style.css</code>, and your image file for upload. Your screen should now look like the following:
<a href="./CS193X_ Web Programming Fundamentals_files/screenshot-uploaded.png">
<img src="./CS193X_ Web Programming Fundamentals_files/screenshot-uploaded.png" class="screenshot">
</a>
      <ul>
        <li>(You actually don’t have to upload <code class="highlighter-rouge">style.css</code> again if you didn’t modify it.)</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Scroll to the bottom of the screen and click the green “Commit changes” button. You don’t need to fill out any of the form.
<a href="./CS193X_ Web Programming Fundamentals_files/screenshot-commit.png">
<img src="./CS193X_ Web Programming Fundamentals_files/screenshot-commit.png" class="screenshot">
</a></li>
    <li>You should be redirected to the main repository screen again. The existing files should be updated and your new files should be uploaded.</li>
  </ul>

<section class="part">

  <h2 id="part-5-publish-your-github-page">Part 5: Publish your GitHub Page</h2>
  <p>You will now publish your website as a GitHub page. This will make your website publicly accessible on the internet. (Please remember the Honor Code section of the <a href="https://web.stanford.edu/class/archive/cs/cs193x/cs193x.1176/info">Course Info</a> page.)</p>
